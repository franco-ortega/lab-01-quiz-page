                In the Aeneid, Vergil's hero fights to claim the king's daughter, Lavinia, with whom he is destined to found an empire. Lavinia herself never speaks a word. Now Lavinia is given a voice in a novel that us the reader to the half-wild world of ancient Italy, when Rome was a muddy village near seven hills.

                <p>
                Lavinia grows up knowing nothing but peace and freedom, until suitors come. Her mother wants her to marry handsome, ambitious Turnus. But omens and propecies spoken by the sacred springs say she must marry a foreigner - that she will be the cause of a bitter war - and that her husband will not live long. When a fleet of Trojan ships sails up the Tiner, Lavinia decides to take her destiny into her own hands. And so she tells us what Vergil did not; the story of her life, and of the love of her life.

                As the daughter of the king of the Latins of Laurentum, Lavinia is sought after by neighbouring kings, but knows she is destined to marry a stranger. This is Aeneas from the Trojan War, who arrives with a large body of Trojans.

                <p>
                An agreement is made but then breaks down and there is war, which is won by the outnumbered Trojans. They found a new city called Lavinium, but Aeneas is killed after three years. Aeneas's elder son Ascanius founds Alba Longa and marries but fails to produce an heir. Lavinia removes her son Silvius from his control and he eventually becomes king of the Latins.
                </p>
                <p>
                Lavinia herself retreats from the world and at the end seems to have turned into an owl. She has all along regarded the world she lives in as unreal, a product of Virgil's imagination.
